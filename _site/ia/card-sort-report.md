## Observations

- Did the participants have any common comments?
	Both participants felt as though some of the topics could fit under more than one heading and were not sure which catergory to choose. 
	
- Did they have questions that stood out?
	N/A
	
- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?
	Topics such as "The future of yoga", "How the practice has evolved" and "A shift in purpose (modernization)" could fall under the category "Western Yoga" as well as "Why yoga?".
	
- Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different?
	I provided 3 catergory headings and both participants were able to sort all of the cards into one of the 3 and they thought they worked well.
	
- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?
	I was a little surpised when the first card sort had "Religious Beliefs" under the "Why yoga?" category because I knew it belonged under "Eastern Yoga" because the practice originated under various religious beliefs but this proved to me that not everyone knows as much as I do about yoga.
	
- Were the results similar to your expectations?
	Other than one or two unexpected card placings for the most part the results were what I was expecting and hoping for.
	
- How did you feel while watching them perform the task?
	I felt confident that I have chosen interesting topics and a wide variety of topics too. My participents showed little to no confusion and were able to sort my cards with ease.
