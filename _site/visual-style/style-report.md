#Style Exploration Report

After creating 3 seperate styles and identities for my large data website I have decided that style-tile-3.jpg is the most appropriate design for my site. My first style-tile has a very traditional, eastern design that reflects the nature and history of yoga very well. However I found that a rich, decorative site does not usually attract a youthful audience as they tend to be more drawn to modern sites. 

Thus I created my second tile in bright purple and pink because those colours have high spiritual energy and represent the energetic side of yoga. Still, I found this style-tile-2 to be more styled towards females and my target audience is for males and females alike. I still prefer a more modern direction of design for my Yoga site so I finally ended up with style-tile-3 which is bright and modern without being overly funky. 

I feel my third style best represents my brand because I want my site to be bright and inviting while still representing the traditional/modern bridge of the yoga movement and will appeal to a wide range of ages due to it's gender-neutral colour palette.
