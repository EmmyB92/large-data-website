Many people feel the spread of yoga into popular culture is not such a good thing.  They may perceive it as too commercialized, too shallow, and lacking in any real meaning other than how to bend like a pretzel. I feel that regardless of how it looks on the surface, the expansion of yoga in the western world is a good thing because it means that there are millions of people whose consciousness has expanded as a result of the practice. Some may beg to differ, claiming that wearing the right outfit, looking good in chattarunga, or standing on one’s head does not lead to greater consciousness, but despite the fact that the average yoga class looks like nothing more than aerobics, it’s still yoga. As a yoga teacher, I believe that it is the yoga that does the teaching, not me. This requires the teacher to step out of the way.

This opens a whole other can of worms because we now have to assume that teachers both want to step out of the way and that they are able to do so—an act which is questionable at best for all humans, not just yoga teachers. In either case, I do have faith that there is a reason why the practice of yoga and other contemplative traditions have become so prolific at this point in human history. I believe engagement in these traditions provide us some measure of hope that we will in fact save ourselves and our planet before it is too late. This is perhaps naive or foolish of me to think so, but it helps me sleep at night.

Just yesterday, I had an interesting discussion with a fellow teacher about control in the studio space. Amongst yoga teachers, there exist varying opinions as to how one should handle the issue of students who show up late or who choose to leave early. Some teachers feel very strongly about this and let their students know that there is no wiggle room available on this matter. Others choose not to deal with it for fear of confrontation, and still others address the matter with the student base as a whole rather than on an individual basis, either in class or through notices and emails.

Over the years my own feelings on this subject have changed only slightly. Basically, I think that if a students shows up, half the battle has been won and any participation on my part should only serve to  encourage the student to follow suit in the future. Yes, there are those students who are driven, dedicated, and committed to the practice, and not always for health reasons, but the average student is just trying to get through life and the last thing they need from me is to be reprimanded for showing up late. As a teacher, my intention is to do my best to meet my students half way, and to trust that whatever they are experiencing is the only possible experience that they could have. It is not my responsiblity to impose upon them what I think they should be experiencing, or what I would prefer for them to experience because that will reflect more favourably on me as their teacher. When a student is perpetually late, however, I address the issue directly with them, often to discover that they are just trying to get from work to class. Because I would rather see a student practice than not practice, I don't see a problem if it is only five minutes that is hindering their commitment.

Is the whole question of the commercialization of the practice not the same? Teachers who dress in fancy yoga gear do not always teach exercise-oriented classes, nor do teachers that appear quite average in size and shape teach only meditative classes. Judging such appearances by the surface goes against all that the practice aims to teach. If I judge the practice or the industry as a whole, am i not also judging my fellow practitioners, teachers, and ultimately myself? Just like the student that arrives late, my intention is to meet myself where I am, rather than imposing upon myself an idea of who I should be as a teacher and practitioner. Should we not also try to meet the evolution of the practice to where we can trust that wherever it stands is the only place that it could be? We are re-inventing a practice that began half way around the world. As such, it needs time to adapt and adjust, and we as teachers and practitioners need time to learn the practice as it is intended for us as individuals.

As the practice of yoga has grown, there has been greater emphasis on deepening our training as teachers, which is beneficial because it helps to diversify the market and minimize competition. This too, however, can become another place for division and separation as teachers struggle to prove themselves, their chosen style, or method of practice, and ultimately to sustain themselves financially. Practice starts and ends with oneself, and ultimately I can only ever teach from my own experience. There will be times when I choose to further explore a particular path of  inquiry, but the path I choose should only serve to illuminate the understanding that I have of myself, rather than merely to add more tools to my kit. From this perspective, perhaps yoga has expanded beyond its worth, but sometimes it takes a long time walking down one road to gain a simple insight or understanding that another may have grasped miles back on the journey.
