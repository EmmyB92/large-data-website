# Yoga Around the World

Yoga is a physical, spiritual, mental pratice that involves stretching and strengthening the body while practising meditation and discipline of mind. There are so many different styles of yoga and I am very interested in learning more about it's Traditional Eastern Origins and the modernization of the yoga practice as it travelled to the Western world.

Yoga is an excellent escape from the every day stress of life by calling upon all of your senses to focus upon relaxing and strengthening the body. Yoga is a great fitness practice as well as a strong spiritual catalyst. 

## Purpose
