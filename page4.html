        	<p>The Yoga practice has been around for thousands of years but it is only recently that the practice has reached great heights over on the Western side of the world. This raises many questions and concerns for some and below are two articles addressing some of those concerns.<br><br>Some people feel Yoga has lost it's authenticity and has fallen victim to commercialization. Others choose to remain unaffected by these claims and their love for Yoga is ever growing and evolving. Take a read below to gain insight into the changing and enlightening world of yoga and why you should be practicing.<br>

	<em>Mindfulness on the Evolution of Yoga</em><br>
<p>Many people feel the spread of yoga into popular culture is not such a good thing.  They may perceive it as too commercialized, too shallow, and lacking in any real meaning other than how to bend like a pretzel. I feel that regardless of how it looks on the surface, the expansion of yoga in the western world is a good thing because it means that there are millions of people whose consciousness has expanded as a result of the practice. Some may beg to differ, claiming that wearing the right outfit, looking good in chattarunga, or standing on one’s head does not lead to greater consciousness, but despite the fact that the average yoga class looks like nothing more than aerobics, it’s still yoga. As a yoga teacher, I believe that it is the yoga that does the teaching, not me. This requires the teacher to step out of the way.<br><br>

This opens a whole other can of worms because we now have to assume that teachers both want to step out of the way and that they are able to do so—an act which is questionable at best for all humans, not just yoga teachers. In either case, I do have faith that there is a reason why the practice of yoga and other contemplative traditions have become so prolific at this point in human history. I believe engagement in these traditions provide us some measure of hope that we will in fact save ourselves and our planet before it is too late. This is perhaps naive or foolish of me to think so, but it helps me sleep at night.<br><br>

Just yesterday, I had an interesting discussion with a fellow teacher about control in the studio space. Amongst yoga teachers, there exist varying opinions as to how one should handle the issue of students who show up late or who choose to leave early. Some teachers feel very strongly about this and let their students know that there is no wiggle room available on this matter. Others choose not to deal with it for fear of confrontation, and still others address the matter with the student base as a whole rather than on an individual basis, either in class or through notices and emails.<br><br>

Over the years my own feelings on this subject have changed only slightly. Basically, I think that if a students shows up, half the battle has been won and any participation on my part should only serve to  encourage the student to follow suit in the future. Yes, there are those students who are driven, dedicated, and committed to the practice, and not always for health reasons, but the average student is just trying to get through life and the last thing they need from me is to be reprimanded for showing up late. As a teacher, my intention is to do my best to meet my students half way, and to trust that whatever they are experiencing is the only possible experience that they could have. It is not my responsiblity to impose upon them what I think they should be experiencing, or what I would prefer for them to experience because that will reflect more favourably on me as their teacher. When a student is perpetually late, however, I address the issue directly with them, often to discover that they are just trying to get from work to class. Because I would rather see a student practice than not practice, I don't see a problem if it is only five minutes that is hindering their commitment.<br><br>

Is the whole question of the commercialization of the practice not the same? Teachers who dress in fancy yoga gear do not always teach exercise-oriented classes, nor do teachers that appear quite average in size and shape teach only meditative classes. Judging such appearances by the surface goes against all that the practice aims to teach. If I judge the practice or the industry as a whole, am i not also judging my fellow practitioners, teachers, and ultimately myself? Just like the student that arrives late, my intention is to meet myself where I am, rather than imposing upon myself an idea of who I should be as a teacher and practitioner. Should we not also try to meet the evolution of the practice to where we can trust that wherever it stands is the only place that it could be? We are re-inventing a practice that began half way around the world. As such, it needs time to adapt and adjust, and we as teachers and practitioners need time to learn the practice as it is intended for us as individuals.<br><br>

As the practice of yoga has grown, there has been greater emphasis on deepening our training as teachers, which is beneficial because it helps to diversify the market and minimize competition. This too, however, can become another place for division and separation as teachers struggle to prove themselves, their chosen style, or method of practice, and ultimately to sustain themselves financially. Practice starts and ends with oneself, and ultimately I can only ever teach from my own experience. There will be times when I choose to further explore a particular path of  inquiry, but the path I choose should only serve to illuminate the understanding that I have of myself, rather than merely to add more tools to my kit. From this perspective, perhaps yoga has expanded beyond its worth, but sometimes it takes a long time walking down one road to gain a simple insight or understanding that another may have grasped miles back on the journey.

<em>Yoga as a Spiritual Practice</em><br>
<p>The typical public perception of Yoga has shifted significantly in recent years. This article addresses the nature of those shifts, comparing traditional Yoga of the ancient sages to the modern revisions. The article also includes quotes from nine different teachers whose names are well known.<br><br>

The starting point of most classes, books, magazines, articles, websites, and blogs on Yoga are so different from traditional Yoga of the ancient sages that it can be fairly called "Not Yoga". The wave of Not Yoga seems to morph further and further away from Yoga.<br><br>

"Traditional yoga" has historically been taught orally, and there are subtle nuances among various lineages and teachers, rather than there being some one, precisely agreed upon "yoga". Principles are usually communicated in sutra style, where brief outlines are expanded upon orally. For example, yoga is outlined in 196 sutras of the Yoga Sutras and then is discussed with and explained by teacher to student. Similarly, the great depth of meaning of Om mantra is outlined in only 12 verses of the Mandukya Upanishad and is expanded upon orally. This article also does not claim that there is a single, universal "Modern Yoga". Here also there are many different faces. However, there has been a quite significant overall shift in the perception of yoga, and that is worthy of comment and ongoing examination.<br><br>

Traditional view: To the ancients, Yoga is a complete system, of which the postures are a small, though quite useful part. The word "Yoga" referred to the whole, not merely one part, which is the postures, or Asanas. The entire purpose of Yoga is spiritual in nature, according to the ancient sages.<br><br>

History of Yoga: The history of Yoga can conveniently be divided into the following four broad categories: Vedic Yoga, Preclassical Yoga, Classical Yoga, Postclassical Yoga.<br><br>

Modern view: In modern times, the relative position of the postures has been elevated, so as to lead people to believe that the word "Yoga" refers to physical postures or Asanas, and that the goal of these is physical fitness. The whole and the part have been reversed, terribly misleading and confusing people about the true nature of authentic Yoga.<br><br> 

Telling Lies that are so big people will believe them.
The Big Lie (German: Große Lüge) is a propaganda technique. The expression was coined by Adolf Hitler in his 1925 autobiography Mein Kampf for a lie so "colossal" that no one would believe that someone "could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously".<br><br>

Black is black and white is white. However, if enough people say that black is white and that white is black, it will be believed and staunchly defended by the followers of that delusion.<br><br>

This is also the case with Yoga. We now have millions of people who totally believe in the Big Lie that Yoga is a gymnastic, exercise or physical fitness program. The lie is so believed that I routinely receive emails attacking me about revealing or highlighting the true nature of Yoga through this and other articles.<br><br>

Asana classes and asana studios: It is so unfortunate that the word "Yoga" has so often been used in place of the word "asana" or "posture" in recent years. We would not call a brick a "house" even though it is part of the construction. Yet, this is what is often done with Yoga. The first word of Yoga Sutras is "atha" which means "now," implying a prior preparation. One may do postures for years and finally be ready for Yoga. To call it "Yoga" before that time is a misnomer. If we had "asana classes" and "asana studios" that would be a great service to people. Then the word "Yoga" could be appropriately used for the journey that one begins when truly understanding the history and nature of authentic, traditional Yoga.Yoga "On" and "Off" the Mat:<br><br>

Within the past few decades there has been a new invention, that of the yoga "mat", which is made of some sort of synthetic rubber or plastic material. This has lead to the idea that "yoga" is practiced "on" such a mat. Since the mat is designed to be used for physical postures or asanas, its invention has even further led to the distortion of yoga. Along with the invention of yoga "on the mat", there has been a subsequent invention of yoga "off the mat" to describe the "other" form of yoga. Google presently reveals 1,220,000 results for a search of "yoga off the mat". While it is good that people are doing other such practices, the mere fact that "yoga off the mat" has come into vogue implies that the default position of real yoga is "on" some synthetic "mat". This is just one more example of setting aside the ancient tradition of authentic yoga for the sake of promoting the modern distorted yoga through all of the yoga business channels.
